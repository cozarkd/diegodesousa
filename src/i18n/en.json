		"CONTENT": "<p>When I was 12, my dad brought home a computer that he could no longer use at work. They told me that if I broke it, I would lose it. A few days later, it was 'broken'. I managed to fix and break it over and over again. That was the start of my relationship with the digital world.</p><p><strong>Graphic Designer</strong> by training, <strong>developer</strong> by vocation. I believe my greatest strength lies at the intersection, understanding the importance of design and translating it into an optimal user experience.</p><p>In recent years, I have focused on <strong>accessible, creative, and high-performance projects</strong>.</p><p>I work as a freelancer with end clients, studios, agencies, and companies creating <strong>creative websites and web applications</strong>; while also working on my personal projects.</p>"
