		"CONTENT": "<p>When I was 12, my father brought home a computer that he could no longer use at work. I was told that if I broke it, I wouldn't have it anymore. A few days later, of course, it was \"broken.\" I managed to fix it and break it over and over again. That was when the seed of my relationship with the digital world was planted.</p><p><strong>Graphic designer</strong> by education, <strong>developer</strong> by vocation. I believe my greatest strength lies precisely at that intersection, understanding the importance of design and translating it into an optimal user experience.</p><p>In recent years, I have focused on <strong>accessible, creative, and high-performance projects</strong>.</p><p>I collaborate as a freelancer with end clients, studios, agencies, and companies creating <strong>creative websites and web applications</strong>; without neglecting <del>too much</del> my personal projects.</p><p>We can communicate in <a href='/'><strong>Spanish</strong> üá™üá∏</a>, <a href='/gl/'><strong>Galician</strong> üå≥</a>, <a href='/en/'><strong>English</strong></a> üá¨üáß, and <a href='/pt/'><strong>Portuguese</strong> üáµüáπ</a>.</p><p>Based in Pontevedra, Galicia, Spain.</p>"
