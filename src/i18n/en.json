		"H2": "About Me",
		"CONTENT": "<p>I trained as a graphic designer, studying the relationship between form and function. Over time, I realized the designs I imagined needed code to come alive. That curiosity led me to web development, and what started as a tool to bring my designs to life became a second calling.</p><p>Today I work as a <strong>full-stack developer and product designer</strong>, combining 10+ years of experience in both disciplines. I understand design from the inside and translate it into clean, efficient code. That intersection is my greatest strength: creating products that not only look good, but work exceptionally well.</p><p>I specialize in two areas: <strong>high-performance websites</strong> that combine polished visual design with technical speed, and <strong>SaaS products</strong> like dashboards, applications, and internal tools that make people's work easier. I use modern web technologies and pay special attention to accessibility, making sure what I build is usable for everyone.</p><p>I work independently from Galicia, Spain, collaborating with clients from different countries. We can communicate in <a href='/'><strong>Spanish</strong> 🇪🇸</a>, <a href='/gl/'><strong>Galician</strong> 🌳</a>, <a href='/en/'><strong>English</strong> 🇬🇧</a>, and <a href='/pt/'><strong>Portuguese</strong> 🇵🇹</a>.</p><p>I care about quality and attention to detail. I believe in doing things right: thoughtful code, intentional design, products that last. If you're looking for someone who understands both the visual and technical sides of your project, let's talk.</p>"
