## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Spanish positioning "Desarrollador Full-Stack & Diseñador de Producto" — User wants Spanish-first positioning matching default site language
- Rewrite About from LinkedIn, not keep storytelling — User prefers professional tone based on LinkedIn summary over personal anecdotes
- Update all 4 languages at once — Consistency across all locales required
- Content update only, no structural changes — User explicitly chose minimal scope
- Design-first narrative structure (01-01) — About section starts with design education, shows evolution to development
- Both service lines with equal weight (01-01) — High-performance websites + SaaS products presented equally
- European Portuguese vocabulary (01-02) — Used pt-PT "programador" not pt-BR "desenvolvedor" to match target market
- Professional Galician register (01-02) — Treated Galician as fully professional language with standard normativa orthography
