## Cross-Phase Integration

**Connections verified:** 15/15
**Orphaned exports:** 0
**Missing connections:** 0

### Key Integration Points

| From | To | Status |
|------|----|--------|
| Zod 4 schemas | Astro 5 Content Layer API | CONNECTED |
| @tailwindcss/vite | Astro 5 Vite config | CONNECTED |
| PostCSS 11 | Vite build pipeline | CONNECTED |
| @astrojs/react | React 19 runtime | CONNECTED |
| Seasonal CSS variables | Tailwind 4 @theme directive | CONNECTED |
| ESLint 10 flat config | TypeScript/Astro files | CONNECTED |
| Content collections | Locale page rendering | CONNECTED |

## E2E Flows

**Flows verified:** 7/7
**Broken flows:** 0

| Flow | Status |
|------|--------|
| Content: markdown → Zod → Content Layer API → pages | COMPLETE |
| Build: source → Vite 6 → Tailwind 4 → PostCSS 11 → production | COMPLETE |
| Theming: season detection → CSS variables → Tailwind → visual | COMPLETE |
| Locale: i18n config → routing → content filtering → pages | COMPLETE |
| Lazy loading: Lozad → View Transitions → observer re-init | COMPLETE |
| Type generation: Astro 5 → content collections → TypeScript types | COMPLETE |
| Production: all phases → production build → 4 locale pages + CSS | COMPLETE |

## Tech Debt

### Phase 4: Styling & Linting

- 9 ESLint errors in existing code (accepted per plan scope — "ESLint runs, not zero warnings")
- ESLint plugin peer dependency warnings with ESLint 10 (transitional until plugins update peerDeps)

### Phase 5: React 19 & PostCSS

- Autoprefixer package kept despite redundancy with postcss-preset-env v11 (safety measure)
- No React components exist yet — infrastructure ready but untested with actual islands

### Phase 3: Astro 5

- ViewTransitions deprecation warnings (pre-existing, low priority)

**Total tech debt:** 5 items across 3 phases. All non-blocking.

## Dependency Versions Verified

| Package | Before | After | Phase |
|---------|--------|-------|-------|
| zod | 3.23.8 | 4.3.6 | 2 |
| astro | 4.5.12 | 5.17.1 | 3 |

## Conclusion

Milestone v2.0 Full Stack Migration has achieved its definition of done. All 18 requirements are satisfied across 4 phases. Cross-phase integration is fully wired with 15 verified connections. All 7 E2E flows complete without breaks. Tech debt is minimal and non-blocking. The site builds, renders, and functions identically to pre-migration state with modernized dependencies.
