<objective>
Update Spanish (es.json) and English (en.json) i18n files with new profile positioning: Full-Stack Developer & Product Designer. Spanish serves as the content source of truth; English is culturally adapted (not translated).

Purpose: Establish the core profile content in the two primary languages — Spanish (default locale) and English (most culturally distinct localization).
Output: Updated es.json and en.json with new SEO metadata, hero headline, about section, and contact form messaging.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Update es.json — Spanish profile content (source of truth)</name>
  <files>src/i18n/es.json</files>
  <action>
Update the following 5 keys in es.json. Leave all other keys untouched.

**1. SEO_TITLE_1:**
Change from "Diego de Sousa | desarrollador frontend" to position as "Desarrollador Full-Stack & Diseñador de Producto". Keep "Diego de Sousa |" prefix.

**2. SEO_DESCRIPTION:**
Rewrite to reflect full-stack development + product design profile. Must mention both service lines (high-performance websites and SaaS products). Target 150-160 characters. Include location signal (Galicia, España). First person voice. Use SEO keywords: "desarrollador full-stack", "diseñador de producto", "webs de alto rendimiento", "productos SaaS".

**3. HERO.H1:**
Rewrite to introduce Diego with new positioning. Keep the `<span class='block'>` wrapper for the name line. Use `<em>` tags for emphasis on key phrases. First person, professional-warm tone. Must reference the dual service offering. Claude's discretion on whether to name both service lines explicitly or use a broader positioning statement in the hero.

**4. ABOUTSECTION.CONTENT:**
Full blank-slate rewrite. Structure with `<p>` tags for paragraphs, `<strong>` for emphasis, `<em>` for italics, `<a>` for language links. Follow these locked decisions:
- First person throughout
- Design-first narrative: start with design background/formal education, show natural evolution into full-stack development ("design led me to code")
- Two service lines with equal weight: high-performance websites (visually polished + technically fast) AND SaaS products (dashboards, applications, internal tools)
- Technology references high-level ("modern web technologies") — no specific framework names
- State 10+ years experience and Galicia/Spain location explicitly
- Mention working independently/freelance
- International client scope — reference the 4 languages
- Include language links with flags: `<a href='/'><strong>español</strong> 🇪🇸</a>`, `<a href='/gl/'><strong>gallego</strong> 🌳</a>`, `<a href='/en/'><strong>inglés</strong></a> 🇬🇧`, `<a href='/pt/'><strong>portugués</strong> 🇵🇹</a>`
- Accessibility as a natural mention in approach (not headline)
- Light personal touch: craft & quality values, care for well-made things, clean code, thoughtful design
- Forward-looking only — no past employers, no client names, no career history
- End with soft CTA ("Let's build something together" style, in Spanish)
- Tone: professional but warm, clear, confident, approachable. Spanish register can be warmer with longer sentences.

**5. CONTACTSECTION.FORM.HELP_PLACEHOLDER:**
Update to include SaaS, applications, and dashboards alongside web development. Keep the casual comma-separated list format with "etc." at the end.

**Important:**
- Do NOT modify any other keys (HEADER, PROJECTSSECTION, COLLABORATIONSSECTION, FOOTER, etc.)
- Preserve exact JSON structure and formatting (tabs for indentation)
- Validate JSON syntax after editing

  <done>
- SEO_TITLE_1 contains "Desarrollador Full-Stack" and "Diseñador de Producto"
- SEO_DESCRIPTION is 150-160 characters, mentions both service lines
- HERO.H1 uses span wrapper, introduces Diego with new positioning
- ABOUTSECTION.CONTENT is a complete rewrite following design-first narrative structure with all required elements
- HELP_PLACEHOLDER includes SaaS, applications/aplicaciones, and dashboards
- JSON parses without error
- No other keys modified

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Localize en.json — English profile content (culturally adapted)</name>
  <files>src/i18n/en.json</files>
  <action>
Update the same 5 keys in en.json. This is a LOCALIZATION, not a translation. English copy should read as native English — more direct, concise, and action-oriented than Spanish. Do NOT translate word-for-word from es.json.

**1. SEO_TITLE_1:**
"Diego de Sousa | Full-Stack Developer & Product Designer"

**2. SEO_DESCRIPTION:**
Rewrite for English-speaking market. 150-160 characters. More direct and concise than Spanish version. Use English SEO keywords: "full-stack developer", "product designer", "high-performance websites", "SaaS applications". Include location signal: "Galicia, Spain". First person.

**3. HERO.H1:**
Localize for English. Keep `<span class='block'>` wrapper for name line. Keep `<em>` tags for emphasis. English is more direct — shorter sentences, action-oriented phrasing. Match the intent of the Spanish hero, not the exact words.

**4. ABOUTSECTION.CONTENT:**
Write as native English copy. Same narrative arc and information as Spanish (design-first, evolution to full-stack, two service lines, freelance, 10+ years, Galicia, accessibility, languages, CTA) but with English discourse patterns: shorter sentences, more direct statements, less subordinate clauses.

Language links with English labels:
- `<a href='/'><strong>Spanish</strong> 🇪🇸</a>`
- `<a href='/gl/'><strong>Galician</strong> 🌳</a>`
- `<a href='/en/'><strong>English</strong></a> 🇬🇧`
- `<a href='/pt/'><strong>Portuguese</strong> 🇵🇹</a>`

Use same HTML tags consistently: `<p>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<a>`.

**5. CONTACTSECTION.FORM.HELP_PLACEHOLDER:**
English version: include SaaS applications, dashboards alongside web design/development. Keep casual list format.

**Important:**
- Do NOT modify any other keys
- Preserve exact JSON structure and formatting (tabs for indentation)
- Content must read as if written by a native English speaker — no translation artifacts
- Validate JSON syntax after editing

  </verify>
  <done>
- SEO_TITLE_1 is "Diego de Sousa | Full-Stack Developer & Product Designer"
- SEO_DESCRIPTION is 150-160 characters, uses English SEO keywords, mentions both service lines
- HERO.H1 reads as native English, uses span wrapper
- ABOUTSECTION.CONTENT reads naturally in English (no translation artifacts), covers all required narrative elements
- HELP_PLACEHOLDER includes SaaS, applications, dashboards
- JSON parses without error
- No other keys modified

After both tasks complete:
1. Run `node -e "JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync('src/i18n/es.json','utf8')); console.log('es.json: valid')"` — must pass
2. Run `node -e "JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync('src/i18n/en.json','utf8')); console.log('en.json: valid')"` — must pass
3. Verify both files have identical key structure (same nested paths)
4. Verify no keys outside the 5 target keys were modified by comparing with git diff
