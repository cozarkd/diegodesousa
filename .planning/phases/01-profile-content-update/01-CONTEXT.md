# Phase 1: Profile Content Update - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-10
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Update all user-facing profile text across 4 i18n JSON files (es, en, pt, gl) to position Diego as "Full-Stack Developer & Product Designer". Covers SEO metadata, hero section, about section, and contact form messaging. Content update only — no structural, layout, or component changes.

## Implementation Decisions

### Writing voice & tone
- First person throughout ("I design and build...")
- Professional but warm register — clear, confident, approachable. Not stiff, not casual.
- Personal brand framing — centered on Diego as a person, his craft, his approach
- Copy length at Claude's discretion per section

### About section emphasis
- Design-first narrative: start with design background, show how it evolved into full-stack development
- Mention formal design education explicitly ("trained as a designer" or similar)
- Present design-to-development transition as a natural evolution ("design led me to code")
- Accessibility as a notable mention — included naturally in the approach, not the headline
- Keep technology references high-level ("modern web technologies") — let portfolio speak to specifics
- State 10+ years experience and Galicia/Spain location explicitly
- Forward-looking only — no career history, past employers, or client names
- Blank slate rewrite — no need to match existing structure
- Light personal touch reflecting craft & quality values — care for well-made things, clean code, thoughtful design, attention to detail
- Explicitly mention working independently/freelance
- International client scope — the 4 languages reflect global reach
- End with a soft CTA ("Let's build something together" style)

### Service framing
- Two service lines (high-performance websites + SaaS products) presented with equal weight
- "High-performance websites" means both: visually polished + technically fast — the full-stack + design advantage
- SaaS scope should specify types: dashboards, applications, internal tools — give clients concrete examples
- Hero section: Claude's discretion on whether to mention both services or use a broader statement

### Contact form messaging
- Include SaaS, applications, and dashboards alongside web development in help text

### Claude's Discretion
- Copy length per section (hero, about, SEO descriptions)
- Hero section: whether to name both service lines or use a broader positioning statement
- Loading skeleton design, spacing, typography (not applicable — content only phase)
- Exact paragraph structure of About section

</decisions>

## Specific Ideas

- Spanish positioning: "Desarrollador Full-Stack & Disenador de Producto"
- About rewrite based on LinkedIn summary content, not existing site storytelling
- Craft & quality as the personal value — Diego cares about well-made things

</specifics>

<languages>
## Language Decisions

- All 4 versions (es, en, pt, gl) should read as native copy — no translation artifacts
- Tone culturally adapted per language (e.g., Spanish warmer, English more direct) while maintaining consistent professional-but-warm voice
- Galician treated as fully professional — not just a cultural gesture
- Portuguese is European Portuguese (pt-PT), not Brazilian
- SEO keywords adapted per language to match local search behavior, not just direct translations

</languages>
